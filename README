NAME
    Data::ResultsHelper - Perl module to helps sort, paginate and display
    results sets

OVERVIEW
      Data::ResultsHelper was written to help display results that can be thought of as an array of arrays.  Examples 
      abound, and the more I work with it, the more I see examples.  Search results, stock ticker quotes, email 
      message summaries, a directory listing, sql query results, this and so much more!

      Data::ResultsHelper takes an array ref of array refs and changes it into a nicely organized hash ref.  Hash keys
